Using redux toolkit for global state of the navigation and carousel. Could of used useContext for this funcionality but since I've been practicing with redux I figured I use redux toolkit.

### Current bugs that are in progress of being fixed:

- There is a small bug where on mobile if you toggle the mobile navbar at a certain scroll height you can still see the background of the main page but the intended effect of the mobile navbar that it fills up the whole screen no matter what. It is a minor bug but is being worked on.
